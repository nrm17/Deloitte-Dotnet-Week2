        Page request
        The page request occurs before the page life cycle begins. When the page is requested by a user,
        ASP.NET determines whether the page needs to be parsed and compiled (therefore beginning the life of
        a page), or whether a cached version of the page can be sent in response without running the page.

        Start
        In the start stage, page properties such as Request and Response are set. At this stage, the page also
        determines whether the request is a postback or a new request and sets the IsPostBack property. The
        page also sets the UICulture property.

        Initialization
        During page initialization, controls on the page are available and each control's UniqueID property is set.
        A master page and themes are also applied to the page if applicable. If the current request is a postback,
        the postback data has not yet been loaded
